      <h3>Role: Trainee Back-End Developer</h3>
     <h4>What does my work consist of?</h4>
          <p>My job as a trainee back-end developer is to build and maintain the code that powers a web application's/ websites server side. This include handling databases, implementing APIs, and coming up with strategies to improve website performance.</p>
          <h4>What qualifications did I need?</h4>
          <p>To become a trainee back-end developer, I needed to have a strong understanding of programming languages such as Java, Python, or Ruby, as well as experience working with databases and web frameworks. I also needed to have a degree in computer science or a related field. Being a Back-end developer also requires very good communication skills as you need to constantly interact with the front-end developers in the team as well as the web designers and possibly clients. This means that you should have good communication and teamwork skills. It also requires a lot of resilience as it can be difficult to find a solution to some problems, but is very rewarding when you do so.</p>
