            <h3>Role: Trainee Back-End Developer</h3>
            <h4>What does my work consist of?</h4>
            <p>As a trainee back-end developer, I design and maintain the server-side of web applications to make sure they are effective, dependable, and scalable. I am in charge of developing, maintaining, testing, and debugging an application's or system's complete back end. This covers the fundamental application logic, databases, data and application integration, API, and any other background operations.</p>
            <h4>What qualifications did I need?</h4>
            <p>I needed a degree in computer science or a similar field, as well as experience working with programming languages like Java, Python, or C#. As a back-end developer, I have noted that problem solving skills are crucial as there are problems and tasks that can be hard to resolve, therefore problem solving skills are crucial. Communication skills are also very important as we are required to communicate with other developers and possibly clients.</p>
